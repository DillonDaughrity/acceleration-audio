This is Acceleration Audio, a project for my Web Development class. The concept is an audio player website that increases the playback speed as the song is playing, causing the song to get faster and faster the longer you listen to the song.

Keyboard Shortcuts:
  Spacebar - Play/Pause
  m - Mute/Unmute
  Right Arrow Key - Skip Forward Five Seconds
  Left Arrow Key - Rewind Five Seconds
